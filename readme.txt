WEKALab is an interface to WEKA from the Matlab command line.  You can learn more about Weka here:

http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/

It provides an extremely simple interface to learn classifiers while giving you the power of Matlab in terms of powerful matrix manipulations.  This is incredibly useful, as so much of the dimensionality reduction algorithms invented in recent years rely on significant matrix algebra.  As such, WEKALab allows you to combine the power of classifiers in WEKA with dimensionality reduction in Matlab.

This is probably the most "finished" software of any in this little repository.  I would be happy to take questions or comments about it.  Many more details can be found in /Matlab Files/readme.txt.
